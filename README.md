# Try out Django Channels today! 

This project is fork from [Heroku Django Channels example](https://github.com/jacobian/channels-example)

This is an example app demonstrating how to use (and deploy) [Django Channels](http://channels.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). It's a simple real-time chat app â€” like a very, very light-weight Slack. There are a bunch of rooms, and everyone in the same room can chat, in real-time, with each other (using WebSockets).

As the official example cannot be deployed on Heroku because it is still in python2, I made some modifications to make it work with python 3, and add the folder to add another application
